### Hello, My Lord, May I? 👋

Before you is a homosapien that has a knack for learning and doing, and [sharing the knowledge I have](https://hackernoon.com/u/Peculiar). Believe you me, I love managing the development of interesting products to solve real-life problems. 

I enjoying [writng](https://hackernoon.com/u/Peculiar) and documenting, [building developer communities](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Lr86mcuNudSFMlwNpqyppB) and sliding my magic fingers on my keyboard till something happens.

I adore continuous learners. I'm specifically referring to folks that are wicked about their personal growth. 😁

✨ Bombastic rhetorics around @unicodeveloper being a human. Lies! My rebuttal accentuates his humanoid status--half-human, half-robot, and definitely half-spirit. 👽

Finally, I'm currently obssessed with all things Product  & improving the quality of life of Africans through [Hrvst](https://www.hrvst.market/) 🍀 🌱
