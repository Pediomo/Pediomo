### Hello, My Lord, May I? 👋

Before you is a homosapien that has a knack for learning, doing, and [sharing knowledge](https://hackernoon.com/u/Peculiar). Believe you me, I love managing the development of interesting products that solve real-life problems, and documenting the journey.

I enjoy [writng](https://hackernoon.com/u/Peculiar), [building developer communities](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Lr86mcuNudSFMlwNpqyppB), and sliding my magic fingers on my keyboard till something happens.

I adore continuous learners. I'm specifically referring to folks that are intentional about their personal growth. 😁

Finally, I'm currently obssessed with all Product Thinking & improving the quality of life of Africans through [Hrvst](https://www.hrvst.market/) 🍀 🌱
